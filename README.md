# guessingGame

Code for guessing game is in SRC file.

The guessing game generates a random number between 1 and 100, A GUI window pops up asking to the user to pick a number. If the user inputs an incorrect response
than a hint is displayed (ex. Your guess was too low, try again) and a running total of guesses used is also displayed. The user then has to press OK in order to continue
the game, this will repeat until the user guesses the correct number. At that point the window will display that the user got the number correct and give the total 
number of attempts at guessing. When the player presses OK the window will automatically close. The answer will also be displayed in the console.
